# Update Summary - Keeper Feature Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Position Rank Based on Scoring
**Previous behavior:** Position rank was based on keeper cost (cheapest = rank 1)

**New behavior:** Position rank is based on total points scored in the league
- Players ranked within their position group (QB, RB, WR, TE, etc.)
- Higher scoring = better rank (rank 1 = highest scorer at that position)
- Example: QB1 is the highest-scoring QB in your league

**Implementation:**
- Added `get_player_stats()` method to `ESPNKeeperLeague` class
- Fetches season total points for all rostered players
- Merges scoring data with keeper eligibility data
- Ranks players by `total_points` (descending) within each position group

**Files modified:**
- [src/gmb/espn_keeper.py](src/gmb/espn_keeper.py) - Added `get_player_stats()` method
- [app.py](app.py) - Merged player stats with keeper data
- [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py) - Updated rank calculation to use `total_points`

---

### 2. âœ… Removed Maximum Keepers Limit (What-If Tool)
**Previous behavior:** Max keepers field limited selections (default: 3)

**New behavior:** No limit on number of keepers selected
- Removed "Max Keepers Allowed" input field
- Updated UI from 3 columns to 2 columns (Budget, Roster Size)
- Changed help text to "Select as many keepers as you want"
- Removed validation that limited selections to max keepers

**Files modified:**
- [app.py](app.py) - Removed max_keepers input and validation

---

### 3. âœ… Updated Keeper Cost Structure
**Previous behavior:** Cost was draft cost + $5 per year kept

**New behavior:** Fixed costs per year:
- **Year 1:** $5
- **Year 2:** $10
- **Year 3:** $15

**Implementation:**
- Created `KEEPER_YEAR_COSTS` dictionary mapping year â†’ cost
- Updated cost calculation logic in `KeeperAnalyzer`
- Cost now based on `years_kept + 1` (next year's cost)

**Updated Keeper Rules message:**
```
Keeper Rules: Players can be kept for up to 3 years.
Cost is $5 for year 1, $10 for year 2, and $15 for year 3.
```

**Files modified:**
- [src/gmb/keeper_constants.py](src/gmb/keeper_constants.py) - Added `KEEPER_YEAR_COSTS` dict
- [src/gmb/keeper.py](src/gmb/keeper.py) - Updated cost calculation
- [app.py](app.py) - Updated rules message

---

### 4. âœ… Fixed Arrow Serialization Error
**Error message:**
```
pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '$5' with type str:
tried to convert to int64. Conversion failed for column Total Cost with type object
```

**Root cause:** DataFrame columns were strings with `$` symbols, preventing conversion to Arrow format

**Solution:**
- Store numeric values in DataFrame columns
- Format with `$` symbols AFTER creating DataFrame
- Apply formatting only for display purposes

**Changes:**
```python
# Before (caused error):
scenarios.append({
    'Total Cost': f'${total_cost:.0f}',  # String with $
    'Remaining Budget': f'${remaining_budget:.0f}',
})

# After (fixed):
scenarios.append({
    'Total Cost': total_cost,  # Numeric value
    'Remaining Budget': remaining_budget,
})
# Then format for display:
scenarios_df['Total Cost'] = scenarios_df['Total Cost'].apply(lambda x: f'${x}')
```

**Files modified:**
- [app.py](app.py) - Fixed scenarios DataFrame construction

## Testing Checklist

### Position Rank
- [ ] Verify position ranks show scoring-based ranks (QB1, QB2, RB1, etc.)
- [ ] Check that highest scorer at each position gets rank 1
- [ ] Confirm ranks only show for players with scoring data
- [ ] Test with players who haven't scored (should show "-")

### Keeper Costs
- [ ] Verify first-year keeper costs show as $5
- [ ] Verify second-year keeper costs show as $10
- [ ] Verify third-year keeper costs show as $15
- [ ] Check that rules message displays correctly with escaped $ symbols

### What-If Tool
- [ ] Confirm max keepers input field is removed
- [ ] Verify you can select unlimited keepers
- [ ] Test scenarios table displays without Arrow errors
- [ ] Check that dollar amounts format correctly in scenarios

### General
- [ ] Run `streamlit run app.py` and verify no errors in terminal
- [ ] Test keeper summary tab loads successfully
- [ ] Verify all metrics calculate correctly

## Example Position Rankings

With the new scoring-based system:

**QB Rankings (based on total points):**
```
Rank 1: Patrick Mahomes  - 285 pts - $5
Rank 2: Josh Allen       - 278 pts - $10
Rank 3: Jalen Hurts      - 265 pts - $5
```

**RB Rankings (based on total points):**
```
Rank 1: Christian McCaffrey - 310 pts - $15
Rank 2: Saquon Barkley      - 285 pts - $10
Rank 3: Derrick Henry       - 260 pts - $5
```

This makes it easy to see who the elite keepers are at each position!

## API Integration Details

### Player Stats Endpoint
```python
url = f"https://lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{league_id}"
params = {"view": "kona_player_info"}
```

**Data retrieved:**
- Player ID, name, position
- Season total points (`appliedTotal` from stats array)
- Team ownership information

**Data structure:**
```json
{
  "teams": [
    {
      "roster": {
        "entries": [
          {
            "playerPoolEntry": {
              "player": {
                "id": 12345,
                "fullName": "Josh Allen",
                "defaultPositionId": 0,
                "stats": [
                  {
                    "statSourceId": 0,
                    "statSplitTypeId": 0,
                    "appliedTotal": 285.4
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

**Caching:** Player stats are cached for 1 hour along with keeper data

**API Calls:** One additional API call per tab load (first time only, then cached)

**Data Volume:** Typically 150-200 players Ã— ~10 fields = minimal overhead

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible improvements:
1. **Weekly position ranks** - Show position rank for each week, not just season total
2. **Position rank trends** - Show if a player is trending up/down
3. **Points per game** - Rank by PPG instead of total (accounts for injuries)
4. **Projected keeper value** - Compare current scoring rank to keeper cost
5. **Rest of season projections** - Include projected points, not just historical

---

1. Position rank now based on league scoring (not keeper cost)
2. Max keepers limit removed from What-If tool
3. Keeper costs updated to $5/$10/$15 for years 1/2/3
4. Arrow serialization error fixed in scenarios table

**Total files modified:** 5
