# Final Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Weekly Scoring Trends - Distinct Colors
**Change:** Updated color palette to use conventional, highly distinct colors

**Before:** Vermont theme colors (greens, browns, golds) - similar tones made lines hard to distinguish

**After:** Bright, conventional colors with maximum contrast:
- Red, Blue, Green, Magenta
- Orange, Purple, Cyan, Gold
- Deep Pink, Dark Turquoise, Lime Green, Orange Red
- Dark Magenta, Tomato, Royal Blue, Hot Pink

**Benefit:** Each team's line is now clearly distinguishable on the chart

---

### 2. ✅ Schedule Strength - Box Plots
**Change:** Replaced bar chart with box plot visualization

**Before:** Bar chart showing average opponent score (single value per team)

**After:** Box plot showing full distribution of opponent scores

**What Box Plots Show:**
- **Box**: Middle 50% of opponent scores (IQR)
- **Line in box**: Median opponent score
- **Whiskers**: Range of scores (excluding outliers)
- **Dots**: Outlier games (exceptionally high/low opponents)

**Benefit:** More descriptive - shows consistency of schedule difficulty, not just average

**Example Insights:**
- Team with tall box = faced varying opponent quality
- Team with short box = consistent opponent difficulty
- High median = tough schedule
- Low median = easy schedule

---

### 3. ✅ Remove Table Indices
**Change:** Removed row indices from standings and OIWP tables

**Modified Tables:**
1. **Current Standings** - Added `hide_index=True`
2. **OIWP Analysis** - Added `.hide(axis='index')` to styled dataframe

**Before:**
```
   | Team Name    | Wins | ...
0  | Team Alpha   | 8    | ...
1  | Team Beta    | 7    | ...
```

**After:**
```
Team Name    | Wins | ...
Team Alpha   | 8    | ...
Team Beta    | 7    | ...
```

**Benefit:** Cleaner display, no unnecessary index column

---

### 4. ✅ Sort League Standings
**Change:** Sort by wins (primary), then points for (secondary)

**Before:** Only sorted by wins
```python
.sort_values("wins", ascending=False)
```

**After:** Tiebreaker using points for
```python
.sort_values(["wins", "points_for"], ascending=[False, False])
```

**Benefit:** Proper tiebreaker - teams with same record sorted by total points scored

**Example:**
```
Team A: 7-6, 1450 pts  <- Ranks higher
Team B: 7-6, 1380 pts
```

---

### 5. ✅ Draft Analysis Tab
**New Tab Added:** "📋 Draft Analysis"

#### Features:

**A. Keeper Selection Summary**
- Table showing which teams selected keepers
- Columns: Team, # of Keepers, Total Cost, Avg Cost, Max Cost
- Sorted by number of keepers (descending)
- Teams with no keepers shown with "-" for costs

**B. Keeper vs Drafted Costs (Grouped Bar Chart)**
- Compares total spending on keepers vs drafted players
- Side-by-side bars for each team
- Shows player counts as labels
- Colors: Green for keepers, Brown for drafted

**C. Stars & Scrubs Analysis (Box Plot)**
- Distribution of draft costs by team
- Wide distribution = Stars & Scrubs strategy (expensive stars + cheap fillers)
- Narrow distribution = Balanced strategy (evenly priced roster)

**Interpretation Guide:**
```
Wide Box (Stars & Scrubs):    Narrow Box (Balanced):
    |                              ---
    |                              | |
  --+--    <- expensive star       | |
  |   |                            | |
  -----    <- cheap players        ---
```

**D. Summary Metrics:**
- Total keepers league-wide
- Average keeper cost
- Average drafted player cost

## Visual Examples

### Weekly Scoring Trends (New Colors)
Each team gets a distinct, vibrant color:
```
Team 1: Red      Team 5: Orange       Team 9:  Deep Pink
Team 2: Blue     Team 6: Purple       Team 10: Dark Turquoise
Team 3: Green    Team 7: Cyan         Team 11: Lime Green
Team 4: Magenta  Team 8: Gold         Team 12: Orange Red
```

### Schedule Strength (Box Plot)
```
Team A: ═══╦═══  <- Wide spread (varied opponent quality)
           ║
Team B:   ═╬═    <- Narrow spread (consistent opponents)
           ║
Team C:     ╬════ <- High median (tough schedule)
```

### Stars & Scrubs Analysis

**Stars & Scrubs Team:**
```
Cost Distribution:
$60  ●              <- 1-2 expensive stars
$50
$40  ┌─┐
$30  │ │
$20  │ │
$10  │ │●●●●●      <- Many cheap players
$5   └─┘
```

**Balanced Team:**
```
Cost Distribution:
$40
$30  ┌─┐
$25  │●│
$20  │ │            <- All players mid-tier cost
$15  └─┘
$10
```

## Testing Checklist

### Color Distinctiveness
- [ ] Verify weekly trends chart shows 12+ distinct colors
- [ ] Check that each team line is easily identifiable
- [ ] Confirm colors remain distinct when lines cross

### Schedule Strength Box Plot
- [ ] Verify box plot shows full distribution (not just average)
- [ ] Check that boxes show IQR correctly
- [ ] Confirm whiskers and outliers display properly
- [ ] Test with teams that have varying opponent difficulty

### Table Indices
- [ ] Confirm standings table has no index column
- [ ] Verify OIWP table has no index column
- [ ] Check that tables still sort correctly without index

### Standings Sort
- [ ] Verify teams with same wins are sorted by points_for
- [ ] Test tiebreaker with actual tied teams
- [ ] Confirm sort order: high wins → high points

### Draft Analysis Tab
- [ ] Verify keeper summary table loads correctly
- [ ] Check keeper vs drafted bar chart displays properly
- [ ] Confirm stars & scrubs box plot shows cost distribution
- [ ] Verify summary metrics calculate correctly
- [ ] Test with leagues that have 0 keepers
- [ ] Test with teams that kept different numbers of players

## Draft Analysis Use Cases

### Strategy Evaluation
**Question:** Did teams go stars & scrubs or balanced?

**How to check:**
1. Go to Draft Analysis tab
2. Look at "Draft Strategy Analysis" box plot
3. Wide boxes = Stars & Scrubs
4. Narrow boxes = Balanced

### Keeper Value Assessment
**Question:** Who got the best keeper deals?

**How to check:**
1. Look at "Keeper Selection Summary" table
2. Compare "Avg Cost" column
3. Lower average = better value keepers

### Budget Allocation
**Question:** How much did teams spend on keepers vs draft?

**How to check:**
1. Look at "Keeper vs Drafted Costs" chart
2. Compare green (keeper) vs brown (drafted) bars
3. Taller green bar = more invested in keepers
