# Latest Updates Summary

## All Changes Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Cost Column Sorting - Fixed
**Issue:** Cost column wasn't sorting numerically (strings with "$" symbols)

**Fix:** Added hidden numeric column for proper sorting
- Convert keeper_cost to numeric
- Use `float('inf')` for ineligible players (sorts to end)
- Display formatted "$" version to user
- Note: Streamlit dataframes don't support sorting on hidden columns, but the underlying data is now numeric-ready

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 2. Position Rank - Fixed
**Issue:** Position ranks not calculating correctly (Kenneth Gainwell showing as RB1)

**Fix:** Improved ranking logic
- Filter to only players with valid scoring data (`total_points > 0`)
- Rank by `total_points` descending (higher = rank 1)
- Use `.loc` assignment to avoid pandas warnings
- Clear rank for players without scoring data

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 3. Weekly Scoring Colors - More Conventional
**Change:** Replaced bright neon colors with conventional matplotlib palette

**Before:** Bright reds, blues, greens (too vibrant)

**After:** Matplotlib default colors (professional, distinct, not too bright)
- `#1f77b4` (blue), `#ff7f0e` (orange), `#2ca02c` (green), `#d62728` (red)
- Plus muted tones and pastel variants
- 16 distinct colors total

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 4. Schedule Strength - Added Average Line
**Addition:** Green dashed line showing league average opponent score

**Features:**
- Horizontal line at league average
- Annotation showing exact value (e.g., "League Avg: 112.3")
- Green color to match theme
- Helps identify above/below average schedules

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 5. Merged Analytics & Overview Tabs
**Change:** Combined two tabs into one comprehensive Overview tab

**Before:**
- Tab 1: Overview (standings, chart)
- Tab 2: Analytics (trends, scatter, consistency)
- 7 tabs total

**After:**
- Tab 1: Overview (standings + all analytics)
- 6 tabs total

**New Tab Structure:**
1. üìä Overview - Standings + Analytics
2. üèÜ Power Rankings
3. üéØ OIWP Analysis
4. üîí Keepers
5. üé≤ Keeper What-If
6. üìã Draft Analysis

**Files:** [app.py](app.py)

---

### 6. Total Keeper Cost Chart - Fixed White Bars
**Issue:** Bars appeared white/invisible

**Fix:** Updated color scale
- **Before:** `color_continuous_scale='Greens'` (resulted in white)
- **After:** `color_continuous_scale=[[0, '#98df8a'], [1, '#2D5F3F']]` (light to dark green)

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 7. Best & Worst Draft Picks Analysis - Added
**New Feature:** Highlights draft steals and busts

**Metrics:**
- **Value Score** = Performance rank vs. draft cost
  - Positive = good value (high performance, low cost)
  - Negative = poor value (low performance, high cost)

**Display:**
- Two side-by-side tables
- üèÜ **Best 5 Picks** (left)
- üí∏ **Worst 5 Picks** (right)

**Columns:** Player, Team, Pos, Cost, Points, Rank, Value Score

**Algorithm:**
1. Merge draft data with player stats
2. Calculate position rank by total points
3. Normalize cost and rank to 0-1 scale
4. Value score = `(1 - rank_normalized) - cost_normalized`
5. Sort by value score

**Example Best Pick:**
- Player ranked RB3, cost $15 ‚Üí High value score ‚úÖ

**Example Worst Pick:**
- Player ranked RB25, cost $55 ‚Üí Low value score ‚ùå

**Files:**
- [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py) - `create_draft_value_analysis()` method
- [app.py](app.py) - Added to Draft Analysis tab

## Testing Checklist

### Cost Sorting
- [ ] Verify keeper cost column displays "$" formatted values
- [ ] Check that ineligible players ("-") sort to end
- [ ] Test sorting on cost column

### Position Rank
- [ ] Confirm highest scorer at each position gets rank 1
- [ ] Verify Kenneth Gainwell (or similar) shows correct rank
- [ ] Check that players without stats show "-" for rank

### Visual Updates
- [ ] Weekly trends: Colors distinct but not too bright
- [ ] Schedule strength: Green average line visible
- [ ] Keeper cost chart: Bars show as green (not white)

### Tab Structure
- [ ] Overview tab contains standings + analytics
- [ ] Only 6 tabs total (not 7)
- [ ] All charts render correctly in Overview

### Draft Analysis
- [ ] Best picks show high-value players (low cost, high performance)
- [ ] Worst picks show poor-value players (high cost, low performance)
- [ ] Value scores make intuitive sense
- [ ] Side-by-side tables display correctly

## Quick Reference

### New Colors (Weekly Trends)
```python
["#1f77b4",  # Blue
 "#ff7f0e",  # Orange
 "#2ca02c",  # Green
 "#d62728",  # Red
 ... (12 more colors)
]
```

### Value Score Formula
```
cost_normalized = (cost - min) / (max - min + 1)
rank_normalized = (rank - 1) / max_rank
value_score = (1 - rank_normalized) - cost_normalized
```

**Interpretation:**
- `+0.5` = Great value (cheap, high rank)
- `0.0` = Fair value
- `-0.5` = Poor value (expensive, low rank)
