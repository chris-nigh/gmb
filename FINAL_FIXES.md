# Final Fixes Summary

## All Changes Completed ✅

### 1. Schedule Strength - Per-Team Averages Added
**Change:** Added green diamond markers showing each team's average opponent score

**Before:** Box plot with one league-wide average line

**After:**
- Box plot showing opponent score distribution per team
- Green diamond marker on each box showing that team's average
- Hover shows exact average value
- Easy to compare team-specific schedule difficulty

**Visual:**
```
Team A:  ⬩ <- average at 115.2
    ══╦══
      ║
Team B:     ⬩ <- average at 108.7
    ══╦══
      ║
```

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

### 2. Position Rank - Improved Calculation
**Change:** Rewrote ranking logic with cleaner merge approach

**Updates:**
- Filter to players with `total_points > 0`
- Rank in separate dataframe, then merge back
- Handles edge cases better
- Added debug comments (commented out)

**Why it might have been wrong before:**
- `.loc` assignment can fail with complex groupby operations
- New approach: calculate ranks separately, then merge

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

**Note:** If still showing incorrect ranks, uncomment debug lines (217-219) to see what data is available

---

### 3. Total Keeper Cost Chart - Removed
**Change:** Completely removed the chart

**Reason:** White bars were hard to see and chart wasn't as useful

**Before:** Two charts side-by-side (Cost + Value)

**After:** One chart (Value Analysis only)

**Files:** [app.py](app.py)

---

### 4. Keeper Value Colors - Matched to Weekly Trends
**Change:** Updated color palette to match weekly scoring trends

**Colors (Matplotlib palette):**
```python
"#1f77b4",  # Blue
"#ff7f0e",  # Orange
"#2ca02c",  # Green
"#d62728",  # Red
... (12 more muted colors)
```

**Benefit:** Consistent color scheme across all visualizations

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 5. League Standings - Changed to Scatter Plot
**Change:** Bar chart → Scatter plot of Wins vs Total Points

**Before:** Bar chart showing only wins

**After:**
- X-axis: Wins
- Y-axis: Total Points Scored
- Team names as labels
- Shows relationship between wins and scoring

**Insights:**
- Teams in top-right: High wins + High scoring (dominant)
- Teams in top-left: Low wins but high scoring (unlucky)
- Teams in bottom-right: High wins but low scoring (lucky)
- Teams in bottom-left: Low wins + low scoring (struggling)

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

---

### 6. Best/Worst Draft Picks - Debug Improvements
**Change:** Added better error handling and debug messages

**Improvements:**
- Separate checks for draft_data and player_stats
- Better error messages if data is missing
- Debug comments to troubleshoot (commented out)
- Clearer message if no scoring data available

**Common Issues:**
1. **No player_stats:** Check if `get_player_stats()` is returning data
2. **No merge matches:** Player names might not match between draft and stats
3. **No points > 0:** Players haven't played yet this season

**To Debug:**
Uncomment lines 859-862 and 871-872 in viz.py to see:
- Data shapes
- Column names
- Merge results
- Players with points

**Files:** [src/gmb/viz.py](src/gmb/viz.py)

## Testing Checklist

### Schedule Strength
- [ ] Green diamond markers appear on each box
- [ ] Hover shows team's average opponent score
- [ ] Averages align with box plot medians

### Position Rank
- [ ] Top scorer at each position shows rank 1
- [ ] Kenneth Gainwell (or similar) shows correct rank
- [ ] If wrong, uncomment debug lines to investigate

### Keeper Charts
- [ ] Total Keeper Cost chart is gone
- [ ] Only Keeper Value Analysis shows
- [ ] Colors match Weekly Trends palette

### Standings
- [ ] Scatter plot shows wins on X, points on Y
- [ ] Team names visible as labels
- [ ] Can identify lucky/unlucky teams

### Draft Analysis
- [ ] Best/Worst picks table appears (if data available)
- [ ] If not showing:
  - Check for error messages
  - Uncomment debug lines
  - Verify player_stats has data

## Debug Guide for Position Rank

If position rank still looks wrong:

1. **Uncomment debug lines in viz.py (217-219):**
```python
st.write("Debug - Position rank calculation:")
st.write(f"Total players: {len(display_df)}")
st.write(f"Players with points > 0: {(display_df['total_points'] > 0).sum()}")
```

2. **Check output:**
- If "Players with points > 0" is 0, no scoring data is available
- Check if `get_player_stats()` is working
- Verify year parameter is correct

3. **Check player names:**
- Draft data and stats must have matching player names
- Case sensitive
- Check for extra spaces

---

## Debug Guide for Best/Worst Picks

If the table doesn't show:

1. **Uncomment debug lines in viz.py (859-862, 871-872):**
```python
st.write(f"Draft data shape: {draft_data.shape}")
st.write(f"Player stats shape: {player_stats.shape}")
st.write(f"After merge shape: {analysis.shape}")
st.write(f"Players with points: {analysis['total_points'].notna().sum()}")
```

2. **Check output:**
- If player_stats is empty, `get_player_stats()` failed
- If merge shape is same but points = 0, names don't match
- If points > 0 but analysis is empty, they all have 0 points

3. **Common fixes:**
- Verify ESPN API is returning stats
- Check year parameter
- Ensure players have actually played games
